# Test‑Start‑MCP (Scaffold)

Safely start and smoke‑test local MCP services from models when their sandboxes can’t run scripts. This folder is a scaffold only — implementation comes next session.

- Spec: see `docs/SPEC.md`
- Quickstart (planned): see `docs/QUICKSTART.md`
- UI smoke (planned): see `docs/PLAYWRIGHT-SMOKE.md`
- Runner (planned): `run-tests-and-server.sh`

Status: Not implemented yet. Server files are placeholders to validate repo layout and docs.
