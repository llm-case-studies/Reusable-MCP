Playwright UI Smoke — Test‑Start‑MCP (Planned)

Intent
- A minimal UI (`/mcp_ui`) to exercise `initialize`, `tools/list`, and `run_script` against the server.

This will mirror other MCPs:
- Install Playwright: `npm i -D playwright && npx playwright install --with-deps chromium`
- Run: `node Test-Start-MCP/scripts/ui-playwright.mjs`

Status: UI script and server endpoints will be implemented in the next session once the SPEC is approved.
