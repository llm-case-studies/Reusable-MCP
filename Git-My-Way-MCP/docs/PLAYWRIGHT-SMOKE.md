Playwright UI Smoke â€” Git-My-Way-MCP (Planned)

Intent
- A minimal UI (`/mcp_ui`) to exercise git tools with guardrails (dry-run by default for commit/push).

Steps (after implementation)
- npm i -D playwright && npx playwright install --with-deps chromium
- node Git-My-Way-MCP/scripts/ui-playwright.mjs
