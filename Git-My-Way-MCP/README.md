# Git-My-Way-MCP (Scaffold)

Uniform, safe git workflows exposed via MCP tools. Standardizes commit/push/PR tasks across models with guardrails (dry-run, require-clean, branch policy). This is a scaffold â€” implementation will follow the SPEC.

- Spec: see `docs/SPEC.md`
- Quickstart: see `docs/QUICKSTART.md`
- UI smoke (planned): see `docs/PLAYWRIGHT-SMOKE.md`
- Runner: `run-tests-and-server.sh`

Status: Not implemented yet. Placeholders included to validate repo layout and enable a docs-first implementation.

Test UIs
- `/docs` (Swagger), `/mcp_ui` (MCP playground), `/start` (interactive UI)
